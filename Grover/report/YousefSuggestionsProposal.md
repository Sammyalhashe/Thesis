Overall nice flow, intro and build up for proposal.  I recommend justifying the paragraphs to look nicer:).  Here is list of my suggestions that you might want to consider, hope it helps:


1)  I was reading today that in August Rigetti announced 128 qubit machine, you might want to include this instead of googles 72 processor.


2) State the significance of  Richard Feynman's idea, which is the idea of achieving an exponential speed up, and tie it in to the next sentence by stating that this has motivated the whole movement. 


3) You can possible add redefine your objective definition to include estimating and measuring the runtime of  Grovers on actual hardware and software through benchmark tests. Investigating the effects of error accumulation on the algorithm, and the practical speed up achieved for solving SVP using Grovers.
